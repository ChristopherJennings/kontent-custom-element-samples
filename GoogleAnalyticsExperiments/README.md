* Add **Custom element** content element

  "clientId": "<YOUR GOOGLE APP CLIENT ID>.apps.googleusercontent.com",
  "accountId": "<YOUR GOOGLE ANALYTICS ACCOUNT ID>",

}
```

## Example output

The element will save a value containing the experiment/variant identifier as well as metadata need for first display of the selector.

```json
[
  "YI5uxeAkRZ-0E1-7oQ5FXg/2",
  {
    "experiment": {
      "id": "YI5uxeAkRZ-0E1-7oQ5FXg",
      "key": "190562962-3",
      "name": "Home page A/B test"
